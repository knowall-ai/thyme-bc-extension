/// Row-level security for the AI timesheet review and time suggestion APIs.
///
/// Who sees what:
/// - A timesheet review and its findings: the time sheet's owner, its approver, a Thyme
///   administrator and the AI agent.
/// - A time suggestion: the user it is for (the time sheet owner of its resource), a
///   Thyme administrator and the AI agent.
/// - A suggestion request (asking the agent to generate suggestions now): the resource's
///   time sheet owner and approver, a Thyme administrator and the AI agent. The same people
///   can create one; only the AI agent can change or delete one. An approver who requests
///   suggestions still can't see them: they stay with the person they are for.
/// - An agent heartbeat (when the agent was last seen): every Thyme user; only the AI agent writes.
/// - A project source link (which repos, DevOps projects, meeting keywords and attendee domains
///   belong to a project): every Thyme user reads them. A Thyme administrator or the project's
///   manager (its Project Manager, or the time sheet owner of its Person Responsible) adds,
///   changes and removes them. The AI agent adds links it learned (always marked Learned) and
///   changes or removes only learned links; a person who edits a learned link adopts it.
///
/// A Thyme administrator is a time sheet administrator (User Setup, the same rule that
/// governs creating time sheets through the API) or a user with the THYME ADMIN
/// permission set. The AI agent is identified by the THYME AI AGENT permission set. Both
/// permission sets count whether assigned directly or through a security group. SUPER
/// on its own does not bypass these rules.
///
/// The API pages apply the filters below in OnOpenPage, so collection reads, $filter
/// queries and GET/PATCH/DELETE by id all only reach records the caller may see. The
/// filters run in SQL (FlowFields), not as per-record checks.
